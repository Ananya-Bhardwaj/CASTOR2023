Go to your confirmation email or the confirmation page and click "Request an invoice." Complete the form and submit your request. If you don’t see the link, go to the Help Center for assistance.

You'll get your invoice after check-out. This email will come from Booking.com or a partner company.

Note: Contacting the property won't help with issuing an invoice, since our partner provider issues the invoice and sends it to you directly or through Booking.com.
If Booking.com charged you incorrectly, visit the Help Center. We'll likely need a copy of your bank statement showing the incorrect charges as well as your booking confirmation number and PIN.

If the property charged you incorrectly, reach out to the property directly for help.
You’ll find payment confirmation in your confirmation email. In the email, there's also an option to download the payment confirmation as a .pdf.
Sometimes you're expected to pay taxes and charges upon arrival. If this is the case, the amount is stated before you book and in your confirmation email. If no amount is stated, you shouldn't pay anything upon arrival.

If the property requests money that you believe is incorrect, go to the Help Center for further support.

Unfortunately, it isn't possible to add this booking to your account. We're working on a way to enable this in the future.
After canceling a booking with us, you should get an email confirming the cancellation. Check your inbox and spam/junk mail folders.

If you get an email from Booking.com about canceling your booking, your booking was canceled and we refunded you. The processing time will depend on your bank. For any questions, contact your bank directly.
